# Mobile Development Plan - Launch Excellence

**Current Status:** 95% Feature Complete, <20% Test Coverage  
**Backend:** âœ… Deployed to Production  
**Mobile:** ðŸš§ 4-5 Weeks to App Stores  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Security Hardening Required

## Executive Summary

The mobile application is **feature-complete and connected to the production backend**, but requires critical security hardening before app store submission. A comprehensive production readiness audit identified 200+ console.log statements, exposed API keys, and missing security features that must be addressed. This plan incorporates findings from PRODUCTION_READINESS_AUDIT.md.

## Current State Analysis

### âœ… Strengths (What's Working)
- **31 screens implemented** covering all user journeys
- **Production backend connection** at `https://roadtrip-mvp-792001900150.us-central1.run.app`
- **Voice recognition** with @react-native-voice/voice
- **Real booking flows** for OpenTable, Ticketmaster, Recreation.gov
- **25+ services** with proper error handling
- **TypeScript** throughout for type safety
- **Offline support** with AsyncStorage caching

### ðŸš¨ Critical Security Issues (From Production Audit)
1. **Console Logging Throughout**
   - 200+ console.log statements leaking sensitive data
   - Must implement proper logging service
   
2. **Hardcoded API Keys & Endpoints**
   - `/src/config/index.ts`: "your_google_maps_api_key"
   - `/src/config/api.ts`: Hardcoded IP addresses
   - `/src/config/env.ts`: Exposed API keys

3. **Missing Security Features**
   - No crash reporting (Sentry configured but not implemented)
   - No certificate pinning
   - Insecure token storage fallback
   - No jailbreak/root detection
   - No code obfuscation

4. **Production Config Issues**
   - MVP_MODE hardcoded to true
   - EAS config has placeholder values
   - Missing network security config
   
5. **Performance Gaps**
   - No image optimization/CDN
   - Missing list virtualization
   - Bundle size not optimized
   - Memory leak risks in services

## 4-5 Week Security Hardening Plan

// services/logger.ts
export const logger = {
  debug: __DEV__ ? console.log : () => {},
  info: __DEV__ ? console.info : () => {},
  warn: console.warn,
  error: (error: Error, context?: any) => {
    if (__DEV__) console.error(error, context);
    // Send to crash reporting in production
    Sentry.captureException(error, { extra: context });
  }
};
```

#### Days 3-5: Fix API Keys & Implement Secure Storage
**Goal:** Remove all hardcoded secrets

**Critical Files to Fix:**
```typescript
// src/config/index.ts - BEFORE
export const MAPS_API_KEY = process.env.MAPS_API_KEY || 'your_google_maps_api_key';

// AFTER
export const MAPS_API_KEY = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY;
if (!MAPS_API_KEY && !__DEV__) {
  throw new Error('Google Maps API key is required in production');
