- [ ] Environment-specific configurations verified
- [ ] Secrets properly separated between environments

### âœ… Testing Completion
- [ ] Unit tests: 85%+ coverage
- [ ] Integration tests: All passing
- [ ] E2E tests: Core flows validated
- [ ] Load tests: 1000+ concurrent users handled
- [ ] Security scan: No critical vulnerabilities

### âœ… Documentation
- [ ] API documentation up to date
- [ ] Deployment guide reviewed
- [ ] Runbooks prepared
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented

## Deployment Preparation

- [ ] Traffic splitting plan ready

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment (T-1 hour)
- [ ] Final staging validation
- [ ] Freeze code changes
- [ ] Notify team of deployment start
- [ ] Verify all team members ready

### 2. Database Migration (T-30 min)

- [ ] Run migration in transaction
- [ ] Verify migration success
- [ ] Test rollback procedure

### 3. Infrastructure Update (T-15 min)
- [ ] Apply Terraform changes
- [ ] Verify infrastructure updates
- [ ] Check service connectivity
- [ ] Validate SSL certificates

### 4. Application Deployment (T-0)
- [ ] Build production image
- [ ] Push to container registry
- [ ] Deploy with blue-green strategy
- [ ] Monitor deployment progress

### 5. Traffic Migration
- [ ] Route 5% traffic to new version
- [ ] Monitor error rates and latency
- [ ] Gradually increase traffic (25%, 50%, 100%)
- [ ] Full cutover when stable

## Post-Deployment Validation

### âœ… Immediate Checks (T+15 min)
- [ ] Health endpoints responding
- [ ] No spike in error rates
- [ ] Performance within SLAs
- [ ] All integrations functional

### âœ… Extended Monitoring (T+1 hour)
- [ ] User reports monitored
- [ ] Business metrics tracking
- [ ] Resource utilization normal
- [ ] No memory leaks detected

### âœ… Full Validation (T+4 hours)
- [ ] Run production smoke tests
- [ ] Verify all features working
- [ ] Check backup systems
- [ ] Validate monitoring alerts

## Rollback Criteria

Initiate rollback if ANY of the following occur:
- [ ] Error rate > 5% for 5 minutes
- [ ] Response time > 2x baseline
- [ ] Critical functionality broken
- [ ] Database corruption detected
- [ ] Security breach identified

## Rollback Procedure

1. **Immediate Actions**
   ```bash
   # Switch traffic back to previous version
   gcloud run services update-traffic roadtrip-backend \
     --to-revisions=PREVIOUS=100 \
     --region=us-central1
   ```

2. **Database Rollback** (if needed)
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   gcloud sql backups restore <BACKUP_ID> \
     --backup-instance=roadtrip-db-production
   ```

3. **Notify stakeholders**
   - Send rollback notification
   - Document issues encountered
   - Schedule post-mortem

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- [ ] All validation tests pass
- [ ] Error rate < 0.1%
- [ ] Response time p95 < 1.5s
- [ ] No critical issues for 4 hours
- [ ] Stakeholder approval received
