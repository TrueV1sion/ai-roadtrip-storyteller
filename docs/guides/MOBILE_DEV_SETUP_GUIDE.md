- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Approval Requests** - Actions requiring your approval
- üìä **System Status** - Health and performance updates
- üö® **Critical Errors** - Immediate attention required

### **SMS Commands You Can Send**
- `status` - Get current development status
- `approve` or `yes` - Approve pending actions
- `reject` or `no` - Reject pending actions  
- `pause` or `stop` - Pause development
- `resume` - Resume development

  }'
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### **Phone Number Verification**
- Only authorized phone numbers can send commands
- Commands from unknown numbers are logged and ignored
- Consider implementing 2FA for sensitive commands

### **Webhook Security**
- Verify webhook signatures (Twilio) or use HTTPS
- Implement rate limiting on webhook endpoints
- Log all incoming messages for audit trails

### **Command Restrictions**
- Critical commands (deploy, rollback) require approval
- Emergency commands bypass normal approval workflows
- All commands are logged with timestamps and source

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Not Receiving SMS Notifications**
1. Check phone number format (include country code)
2. Verify SMS provider credentials
3. Check webhook configuration
4. Review application logs for errors

### **SMS Commands Not Working**
1. Verify your number is in `DEV_AUTHORIZED_PHONES`
2. Check webhook URL is accessible
3. Test with simple commands like `help` first
4. Review webhook logs for parsing errors

### **Provider-Specific Issues**

#### **Twilio Issues**
- Verify account has SMS enabled
- Check message logs in Twilio console
- Ensure webhook URL uses HTTPS

#### **AWS SNS Issues**
- Verify IAM permissions for SNS
- Check SNS topic configuration
- Ensure region matches configuration

### **Emergency Fallback**
If SMS system fails, you can still control development via:
1. Direct API calls with admin token
2. Server SSH access
3. Cloud console interfaces
4. Email notifications (if configured)

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the application logs: `docker logs roadtrip-api`
2. Verify webhook connectivity: Test webhook URLs
3. Test with curl commands for API debugging
4. Check SMS provider status pages

**Remember**: This system gives you powerful remote control over your development environment. Use commands carefully, especially `deploy` and `rollback` in production environments.

The mobile development control system ensures you stay connected to your development progress even when away from your laptop, allowing for continuous development momentum and quick response to critical issues.
