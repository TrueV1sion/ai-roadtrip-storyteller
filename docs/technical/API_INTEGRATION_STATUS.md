## Technical Integration Patterns

### Standard Integration Flow
```python
class PartnerClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, mock_mode: bool = False):
        self.mock_mode = mock_mode or not api_key
        
    async def search(self, criteria: Dict) -> List[Result]:
        if self.mock_mode:
            return self._mock_search(criteria)
        return await self._live_search(criteria)
        
    async def book(self, item_id: str, details: Dict) -> Booking:
        if self.mock_mode:
            return self._mock_booking(item_id, details)
        return await self._live_booking(item_id, details)
```

### Commission Tracking
```python
class CommissionTracker:
    RATES = {
        'recreation_gov': 0.05,
        'opentable': 0.10,
        'viator': 0.08,
        'shell_recharge': 0.03,
    }
    
    def calculate_commission(self, provider: str, amount: Decimal) -> Decimal:
        rate = self.RATES.get(provider, 0)
        return amount * rate
```
