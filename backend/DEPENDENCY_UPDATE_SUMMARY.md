# Dependency Update Summary

## Critical Missing Dependencies Added

### 1. Task Queue Dependencies (Celery)
- **celery==5.3.4** - Distributed task queue for async processing
- **kombu==5.3.4** - Messaging library for Celery
- **billiard==4.2.0** - Python multiprocessing fork for Celery
- **vine==5.1.0** - Promise library for Celery
- **amqp==5.2.0** - AMQP client library for Celery

### 2. GraphQL Dependencies
- **strawberry-graphql==0.217.1** - Modern GraphQL library for Python

### 3. Security Updates
- **aiohttp** updated from 3.9.1 to **3.9.3** to fix CVE-2024-23334

## Verification Scripts

### 1. verify_dependencies.py
Tests that all required packages can be imported successfully.

Usage:
```bash
cd backend
python verify_dependencies.py
```

### 2. check_dependency_conflicts.py
Checks for dependency conflicts and security vulnerabilities.

Usage:
```bash
cd backend
python check_dependency_conflicts.py
```

## Installation

To install all dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Why These Were Missing

These dependencies were imported in the codebase but not included in requirements.txt:
- Celery is used for async task processing in multiple modules
- Strawberry GraphQL is used for the GraphQL API endpoints
- The aiohttp update addresses a known security vulnerability

## Next Steps

1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
2. Run verification scripts to ensure everything works
3. Deploy with confidence knowing all dependencies are properly specified
