# Monitoring & Observability DMAIC Report
## AI Road Trip Storyteller

### Executive Summary
- **Date**: 2025-07-14 01:05:12
- **Objective**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability
- **Status**: ✅ Monitoring stack configured
- **Components**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger, AlertManager

### DEFINE Phase Results
#### Golden Signals Monitored:
- Latency: Request duration and response times
- Traffic: Request rate and throughput
- Errors: Error rate and types
- Saturation: Resource utilization

#### SLO Targets:
- Availability: 99.9%
- Latency P95: 200ms
- Error Rate: 0.1%

### MEASURE Phase Results
#### Current Monitoring Coverage:
- Infrastructure Metrics: 30%
- Application Metrics: 20%
- Business Metrics: 10%
- Custom Metrics: 0%


### ANALYZE Phase Results

- Alert Tuning: Bi-weekly
- SLO Review: Monthly

### Implementation Summary
1. **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus with service discovery
2. **Visualization**: Grafana with 3 primary dashboards
3. **Logging**: Centralized with Loki
4. **Tracing**: Distributed tracing with Jaeger
5. **Alerting**: 8 critical alerts configured

### Next Steps
1. Deploy monitoring stack to production
2. Configure notification channels
3. Train team on dashboards
4. Establish on-call rotation
5. Run first incident response drill
