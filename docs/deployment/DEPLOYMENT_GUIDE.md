**Target Sigma Level**: 6.0Ïƒ (3.4 defects per million deployments)  
**Current Status**: Production Ready âœ…

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- Google Cloud SDK 450.0+
- Terraform 1.5+ (for infrastructure)
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+

### Required Access
- Google Cloud Project with Owner role
- GitHub repository access
- Domain name configured
- SSL certificates

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/roadtrip.git
cd roadtrip

# Install deployment tools
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
npm install -g @google-cloud/cloud-build

# Authenticate with Google Cloud
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

## ðŸš€ Deployment Environments

### Development (Local)
```bash
# Start all services locally
docker-compose up -d

# Verify services
./scripts/health-check.sh development
```

### Staging
```bash
# Deploy to staging
./deploy.sh staging YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Run integration tests
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh staging

# Verify deployment
./scripts/validate-deployment.sh staging
```

### Production
```bash
# Pre-deployment checklist
./scripts/pre-deployment-check.sh

# Deploy to production
./deploy.sh production YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Post-deployment validation
./scripts/post-deployment-validation.sh

# Enable monitoring
./scripts/enable-monitoring.sh production
```

## ðŸ“Š Deployment Metrics

### Success Criteria
- Deployment Time: < 30 minutes
- Zero Downtime: Blue-Green deployment
- Rollback Time: < 5 minutes
- Error Rate: < 0.01%

### Key Performance Indicators
- API Response Time: < 200ms (p95)
- Voice Processing: < 2s
- Concurrent Users: 10,000+
- Uptime SLA: 99.9%

## ðŸ”„ Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollback
```bash
# Triggered automatically if health checks fail
# Manual trigger:
./scripts/rollback.sh production
```

### Manual Rollback Steps
1. Identify the issue in monitoring
2. Execute rollback script
3. Verify previous version is running
4. Investigate root cause
5. Create incident report

## âœ… Validation Checklist

- [ ] Database connections verified
- [ ] Redis cache working
- [ ] Knowledge Graph accessible
- [ ] Mobile app connecting
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards active

## ðŸ†˜ Emergency Procedures

### Critical Issue Response
1. **Immediate**: Execute rollback
2. **Within 5 min**: Notify stakeholders
3. **Within 15 min**: Root cause analysis
4. **Within 1 hour**: Fix and redeploy

### Support Escalation
- L1: On-call engineer
- L2: Backend team lead
- L3: CTO/Architecture team

## ðŸ“ˆ Continuous Improvement

### Deployment Metrics Tracking
