## Configuration Differences


## Production Readiness Checklist

Based on the comparison, verify the following before production deployment:

### Critical Items
- [ ] All critical configurations match (except for intended differences)
- [ ] Security settings are properly configured
- [ ] Database connections are correctly set
- [ ] API keys and secrets are environment-specific
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are configured

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Load test with production-like traffic
- [ ] Verify response times match production SLAs
- [ ] Test auto-scaling behavior
- [ ] Validate caching effectiveness

### Security Validation
- [ ] Run security scan on staging
- [ ] Verify WAF rules are active
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Validate rate limiting

### Data Validation
- [ ] Test with production-like data volume
- [ ] Verify backup/restore procedures
- [ ] Test data migration scripts
- [ ] Validate data retention policies

### Integration Testing
- [ ] All third-party APIs tested
- [ ] Payment processing (test mode)
- [ ] Email delivery
- [ ] Push notifications

## Recommendations

1. **Resource Scaling**: Staging intentionally uses smaller resources. For accurate performance testing, consider temporarily scaling up.

2. **Data Volume**: Load staging with realistic data volumes for accurate testing.

3. **Traffic Patterns**: Use load testing to simulate production traffic patterns.

4. **Monitoring**: Ensure staging metrics are being collected for comparison.

5. **Security**: Run the same security scans on staging as production.
