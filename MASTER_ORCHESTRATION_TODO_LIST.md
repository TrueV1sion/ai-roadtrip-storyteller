## 🔄 Execution Workflow

### For Each Subagent:
```python
# Autonomous execution pattern
class SubAgent:
    def execute_task(self, task_id):
        task = self.get_task(task_id)
        
        # 1. Claim task
        self.claim_task(task_id)
        
        # 2. Execute
        result = self.perform_work(task)
        
        # 3. Validate
        if self.validate_completion(task, result):
            self.mark_complete(task_id)
        else:
            self.mark_failed(task_id, result.error)
            
        # 4. Document
        self.log_changes(task_id, result)
        
        # 5. Update Knowledge Graph
        self.update_knowledge_graph(task_id, result)
```

### Coordination Protocol:
1. **No Blocking**: Tasks can be executed in parallel
2. **Atomic Changes**: Each task is self-contained
3. **Rollback Ready**: All changes can be reverted
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Knowledge Graph prevents conflicts

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Completion Tracking:
- **P0 Tasks**: Must complete within 48 hours
- **P1 Tasks**: Target 1-2 weeks
- **P2 Tasks**: Target 3-4 weeks
- **P3 Tasks**: Target 5-6 weeks
- **P4 Tasks**: Target 7-8 weeks

### Quality Gates:
- Each task must pass automated tests
- Code review required for P0/P1 tasks
- Performance impact measured for all changes
- Security scan must pass after each task
