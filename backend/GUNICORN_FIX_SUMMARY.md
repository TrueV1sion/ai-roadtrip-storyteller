# Gunicorn Configuration Fix Summary

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Directory Path Error (CRITICAL)**
- **Issue**: `chdir = '/app/backend'` was incorrect
- **Fix**: Changed to `chdir = '/app'` 
- **Reason**: The Dockerfile copies the application to `/app`, not `/app/backend`

### 2. **Timeout Configuration**
- **Issue**: Default timeout of 120 seconds was too short for AI operations
- **Fix**: Increased to 600 seconds (10 minutes) to match Cloud Run's timeout
- **Reason**: AI story generation and voice synthesis can take several minutes

### 3. **Django Settings Reference**
- **Issue**: `raw_env` included Django settings which don't apply to FastAPI
- **Fix**: Removed `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` from environment
- **Reason**: This is a FastAPI application, not Django

### 4. **Development Path Error**
- **Issue**: `reload_extra_files` pointed to wrong path in development mode
- **Fix**: Changed from `'./backend/app/'` to `'./app/'`
- **Reason**: Consistent with the corrected working directory

## New Files Created

### 1. `/backend/gunicorn.prod.conf.py`
A production-optimized configuration file with:
- Cloud Run specific optimizations
- Proper worker lifecycle management
- Database connection reset after fork
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring hooks
- Automatic detection of Cloud Run environment

### 2. `/backend/start.sh`
A startup script that:
- Uses the production config file if available
- Falls back to command-line arguments if not
- Provides consistent startup behavior

## Dockerfile Updates

Updated the Dockerfile to:
- Make the startup script executable
- Use the startup script instead of inline gunicorn command
- Ensure proper permissions are set

## Key Configuration Values

```python
# Production settings
workers = min(cpu_count * 2, 8)  # Optimal for Cloud Run
timeout = 600  # 10 minutes for AI operations
worker_class = 'uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker'  # Required for FastAPI async
max_requests = 10000  # Higher limit for production
graceful_timeout = 30  # Clean shutdown time
```

## Deployment Instructions

1. The fixes are backward compatible - existing deployments will continue to work
2. New deployments will automatically use the improved configuration
3. No environment variable changes required
4. The startup script handles both development and production environments

## Testing the Fix

To verify the configuration is correct:

```bash
# Local test
cd backend
gunicorn app.main:app -c gunicorn_config.py --check-config

# Production test (after deployment)
curl https://your-service-url/health
```

## Impact

These fixes resolve:
- Startup crashes due to incorrect directory paths
- Timeout errors during AI operations
- Potential connection pool issues in forked workers
- Development environment reload issues

The application will now start correctly and handle long-running AI operations without timing out.
