# Bare Except Blocks Fix Summary

## Overview
Successfully fixed all 85 bare except blocks found in the codebase to improve error handling and prevent silent failures in production.

## Changes Made

### 1. Automatic Conversion
- Converted all `except:` statements to `except Exception as e:`
- This ensures that system-exiting exceptions like `KeyboardInterrupt` and `SystemExit` are not caught

### 2. Enhanced Logging
Added proper logging to critical files:

#### backend/app/core/api_security.py
- Line 287: Added logging for timestamp validation failures

#### backend/app/middleware/api_versioning.py  
- Line 153: Added logging for JSON parsing errors during request transformation

#### backend/app/middleware/security_monitoring_v2.py
- Line 161: Added logging for request body reading failures
- Line 214: Added logging for authentication request parsing errors

#### backend/app/middleware/rate_limit_middleware.py
- Line 346: Added logging for Redis errors in rate limit calculations
- Line 446: Added logging for Redis errors when storing violations
- Line 541: Added logging for JSON parsing errors

#### backend/app/integrations/recreation_gov_client.py
- Line 1115: Added logging for facility activities retrieval failures
- Line 1134: Added logging for facility media retrieval failures

## Files Modified
- 52 Python files across the codebase
- Total of 85 bare except blocks fixed

## Verification
Created `backend/verify_no_bare_except.py` script to ensure no bare except blocks remain in the codebase.

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Always use specific exception types** when possible:
   ```python
   try:
       data = json.loads(response)
   except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
       logger.error(f"Failed to parse JSON: {e}")
   ```

2. **Log all exceptions** in production code:
   ```python
   except Exception as e:
       logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
       # Handle appropriately
   ```

3. **Never use bare except** blocks as they can hide critical errors and make debugging difficult

4. **Consider the exception hierarchy**:
   - Use specific exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`, `KeyError`) when you know what to expect
   - Use `Exception` as a catch-all for unexpected errors
   - Let system exceptions (`KeyboardInterrupt`, `SystemExit`) propagate

## Impact
- Improved error visibility in production
- Better debugging capabilities
- Prevents silent failures that could lead to data corruption or security issues
- Ensures proper cleanup and error handling throughout the application
