### Security Architecture

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT with RS256**: Cryptographically secure token signing
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: TOTP-based 2FA with backup codes
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions system
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with timeouts

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 for sensitive data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **PII Handling**: Automatic encryption of personal information
- **Key Management**: Secure key storage and rotation

#### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Redis-based sliding window algorithm
- **CORS Policy**: Restricted to authorized domains
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation and sanitization

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Secrets Management**: Cloud-native secret storage
- **Network Security**: VPC isolation and firewall rules
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for all services
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
