# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation
## AI Road Trip Storyteller

### Overview
This document describes the CI/CD pipeline implementation for the AI Road Trip Storyteller application.

### Pipeline Architecture

#### Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Trigger**: Push to main/develop branches, Pull Requests
- **Stages**:
  1. Code Quality (linting, formatting)
  2. Security Scanning (Bandit, Safety, Trivy)
  3. Unit Tests (85% coverage requirement)
  4. Integration Tests
  5. Build Artifacts

#### Continuous Deployment (CD)
- **Trigger**: Push to main (auto-deploy to staging), Manual for production
- **Deployment Strategy**: Blue-Green deployment
- **Environments**:
  - Staging: Automatic deployment
  - Production: Manual approval required

### Quality Gates
- Test Coverage: Minimum 85%
- Security Vulnerabilities: Zero critical/high
- Code Quality: Grade A
- Performance: No regression > 20%

### Rollback Procedure
1. Automatic rollback on health check failure
2. Manual rollback via GitHub Actions UI
3. Traffic shifting for gradual rollback

### Monitoring
- Build success rate
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR)

### Security
- Secrets stored in GitHub Secrets
- Service account with minimal permissions
- Container scanning with Trivy
- Dependency scanning with Safety

### Local Development
```bash
# Run CI checks locally
make ci-local

# Test deployment script
./scripts/deployment/deploy.sh
```

### Troubleshooting
1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify GCP permissions
3. Check Cloud Run logs
4. Review monitoring dashboards
