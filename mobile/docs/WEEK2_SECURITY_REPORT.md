## 🚀 New Security Commands

```bash
# Build production app with all security features
npm run build:production

# Verify security implementation
npm run verify:obfuscation
npm run security:scan

# Extract and upload source maps
npm run sourcemaps:extract
npm run sourcemaps:upload

```

## 📱 Security Response Matrix

| Feature | Min Security Level | Jailbreak Response |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Payments | HIGH | Block |
| Biometric Auth | HIGH | Block |
| Booking | MEDIUM | Warn |
| Voice Commands | LOW | Log |
| Story Generation | NONE | Allow |

## 🛡️ Runtime Security Features

### Device Security Check
```typescript
const security = await SecurityService.checkDevice();
if (security.level >= SecurityLevel.HIGH) {
  // Safe to proceed with sensitive operations
}
```

### Certificate Pinning Active
```typescript
// All API calls automatically validated
const response = await secureApiClient.get('/api/endpoint');
// Certificate automatically verified against pins
```

### Crash Monitoring
```typescript
// Automatic error capture
try {
  riskyOperation();
} catch (error) {
  // Automatically sent to Sentry with context
  throw error;
}
```

## 📋 Remaining Tasks (Weeks 3-5)

### Week 3: Performance & Testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security testing suite
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Bundle size optimization

### Week 4: App Store Preparation
- [ ] App icons and splash screens
- [ ] Store descriptions
- [ ] Screenshots
- [ ] Privacy policy updates

### Week 5: Submission
- [ ] Final security audit
- [ ] App store submission
- [ ] Review feedback handling

## 🎯 Next Immediate Actions

1. **Configure Sentry**:
   - Add `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` to `.env`
   - Set up Sentry project and alerts

2. **Update Certificate Pins**:
   - Calculate production server certificate pins
   - Add to `CertificatePinningService.ts`

3. **Test Security Features**:
   - Run on jailbroken/rooted test devices
   - Verify certificate pinning with proxy tools
   - Test crash reporting

4. **Performance Testing**:
