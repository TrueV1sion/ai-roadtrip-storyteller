fontFamily: 'Inter-Medium'
fontFamily: 'Inter-SemiBold'
fontFamily: 'Inter-Bold'
```
- Consistent use of Inter font family
- Clear hierarchy with 4 font weights
- Excellent readability across all sizes

### 3. **Component Architecture**
- **Atomic Design Pattern**: Button, Card, Input components
- **Variant System**: Primary, secondary, outline, ghost, danger
- **Size System**: Small, medium, large consistently applied
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety for props

### 4. **Color Palette Excellence**
```typescript
Primary: '#4f46e5' (Indigo)
Success: '#10b981' (Emerald)

Danger: '#ef4444'  (Red)
Purple: '#7c3aed'  (Voice/AI features)
```
- Cohesive color system with semantic meaning
- Each personality has unique accent color
- Consistent use across components

### 5. **Animation & Microinteractions**
```typescript
activeOpacity={0.8}
visualizerBar with dynamic heights
Real-time waveform visualization
```
- Smooth touch feedback
- Voice visualizer is particularly impressive
- Adds life to the interface

## üí° Brilliant UI Patterns to Adopt

### 1. **Voice Personality Cards**
- Horizontal scrolling with images
- Color-coded borders matching personality

### 2. **Recording Interface**
```typescript
// The visualizer bars during recording
{[...Array(20)].map((_, index) => (
  <View style={[styles.visualizerBar, {
    height: isRecording ? Math.random() * 40 + 10 : 4,
    backgroundColor: isRecording ? '#7c3aed' : '#374151',
  }]} />
))}
```
This is genius - visual feedback for voice input!

### 3. **Story Cards**
- Play button integration
- Metadata display (narrator, duration, location)
- Inline actions (like, share)
- Clean information hierarchy

### 4. **Feature Cards Pattern**
- Icon + Title + Description
- Consistent spacing and sizing

### 2. **Responsive Design**
```typescript
const { width } = Dimensions.get('window');
width: width * 0.6, // Responsive card widths
```
- Adapts to screen sizes
- Platform-specific adjustments

### 3. **Navigation Structure**
- Tab-based navigation
- Auth flow separation
- Clean routing with expo-router

## üöÄ Recommendations for Our App
