## Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk Level: HIGH**

The application has critical security vulnerabilities and stability issues that must be addressed before production use. The backend, while deployed, is not production-ready due to authentication failures, missing rate limiting, and incomplete error handling. The mobile app requires significant security hardening before app store submission.

## Conclusion

While the AI Road Trip Storyteller has an impressive feature set and architecture, it requires approximately 4-5 weeks of focused development to address critical issues before it can be considered production-ready. The most urgent priorities are fixing authentication, removing hardcoded credentials, and implementing proper security measures.
