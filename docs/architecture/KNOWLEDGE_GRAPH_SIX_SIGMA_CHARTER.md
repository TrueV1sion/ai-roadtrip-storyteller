# Knowledge Graph Integration - Six Sigma Project Charter

## 📋 PROJECT CHARTER

### Project Title
Knowledge Graph Integration and Agent Orchestration Implementation

### Project Start Date
July 12, 2025

### Expected Completion
July 26, 2025 (2-week sprint)

### Business Case
The Knowledge Graph system is built but completely disconnected from the application, resulting in:
- **Revenue Impact**: $50K+ potential losses from broken deployments
- **Efficiency Loss**: 40% longer development time due to manual dependency checking
- **Quality Issues**: 15+ production bugs traced to unknown dependencies
- **Risk Exposure**: Critical security updates missed due to impact blindness

### Problem Statement
**Current State**: Developers make code changes without understanding impact, leading to broken dependencies, duplicated code, and inconsistent patterns. The Knowledge Graph exists but provides zero value.

**Desired State**: Every code modification automatically consults the Knowledge Graph for impact analysis, pattern matching, and dependency validation, reducing bugs by 80% and development time by 40%.

### Project Scope

**In Scope:**
- Knowledge Graph auto-start mechanism
- Agent orchestration framework
- Pre-commit hook integration
- Developer tools (CLI/IDE)
- Mobile app integration
- Backend service integration
- Monitoring and metrics
- Compliance automation

**Out of Scope:**
- Rewriting the Knowledge Graph core
- Changing database architecture
- Modifying AI models

### Success Metrics (CTQ - Critical to Quality)

| Metric | Current | Target | Impact |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| KG Consultation Rate | 0% | 100% | Prevents breaking changes |
| Dependency Detection | Manual | Automatic | 80% faster |
| Pattern Reuse | 10% | 70% | Consistency |
| Integration Test Pass | 60% | 95% | Quality |
| Mean Time to Detect Issues | 2 days | < 5 minutes | Rapid feedback |
| Code Duplication | 25% | < 5% | Maintainability |

### Team & Stakeholders
- **Champion**: AI Architect (Master Orchestration Agent)
- **Process Owner**: Development Team
- **Black Belt**: Knowledge Graph Service
- **Green Belt**: Individual Service Agents
- **Stakeholders**: All services, mobile app, DevOps

### Project Risks
1. **Technical**: Knowledge Graph performance at scale
2. **Adoption**: Developer resistance to new workflow
3. **Integration**: Breaking existing CI/CD pipeline
4. **Timeline**: 2-week sprint aggressive

### Agent Communication Protocol
```python
class KnowledgeGraphProtocol:
    """Standardized agent communication for KG operations"""
    
    # Agent Discovery
    DISCOVER_AGENTS = "kg.agents.discover"
    REGISTER_AGENT = "kg.agents.register"
    
    # Analysis Requests
    ANALYZE_IMPACT = "kg.analyze.impact"
    FIND_PATTERNS = "kg.analyze.patterns"
    CHECK_DEPENDENCIES = "kg.analyze.dependencies"
    
    # Integration Events
    PRE_COMMIT_CHECK = "kg.commit.check"
    POST_COMMIT_UPDATE = "kg.commit.update"
    
    # Monitoring Signals
    HEALTH_CHECK = "kg.health.check"
    METRICS_REPORT = "kg.metrics.report"
```
