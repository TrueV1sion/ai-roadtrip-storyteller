   - iOS: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
   - Android: [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)

2. Open Expo Go and:

If QR code doesn't work, in Expo Go app:

- Enter: `exp://localhost:19000`

## Troubleshooting:

**If the app doesn't load:**
1. Make sure your phone is on the same WiFi network
2. Check that backend is running: http://localhost:8000/docs
3. Try restarting with: `npx expo start -c` (clears cache)

**If you see connection errors:**
- The app needs the backend API at http://localhost:8000
- Make sure the backend is still running
- Check firewall isn't blocking port 8000

## Current Status:
- âœ… Backend API: Running on http://localhost:8000
- âœ… Mobile App: Starting on http://localhost:19000
- ðŸ“± Ready for: Phone, Simulator, or Web viewing
