# 🚀 AI Road Trip Storyteller - Development Environment is RUNNING!

## ✅ Backend API is Active!

The backend server is already running from our earlier work. You can access it now:

### 🌐 Access Points:

1. **API Documentation (Interactive)**
   - URL: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - This shows all available API endpoints
   - You can test endpoints directly from the browser

### 📱 To View the Mobile App:

Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
cd mobile
npm install --legacy-peer-deps  # First time only
npm start
```

This will:
