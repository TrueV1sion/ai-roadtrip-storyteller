# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE ðŸš¨

## Compromised Credentials Alert

The following credentials were found exposed in the codebase and have been removed:

### Twilio Credentials (COMPROMISED - MUST ROTATE)
- Account SID: `[REDACTED]`
- Auth Token: `[REDACTED]`
- Phone Number: `[REDACTED]`

### Google Maps API Key (COMPROMISED - MUST ROTATE)
- API Key: `[REDACTED]`

## Required Actions

1. **IMMEDIATELY rotate all compromised credentials:**
   - Log into Twilio console and regenerate Account SID and Auth Token
   - Log into Google Cloud Console and create a new Maps API key
   - Delete/disable the old credentials

2. **Update credentials in secure storage:**
   - Use Google Secret Manager for production
   - Use `.env` files (not committed) for development
   - Never hardcode credentials in source code

3. **Review git history:**
   - Check if these credentials were ever committed to git
   - If yes, consider the repository compromised
   - Force push to remove history if necessary

4. **Monitor for abuse:**
   - Check Twilio usage logs for unauthorized use
   - Check Google Maps API usage for unusual activity
   - Set up billing alerts

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **JWT Security**: Upgraded from HS256 to RS256 algorithm
2. **API Key Protection**: Created proxy endpoints for Google Maps
3. **Environment Templates**: Added `.env.template` for safe examples
4. **Gitignore**: Verified `.env` files are excluded from version control

## Preventing Future Incidents

1. Use pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets
2. Regular security audits
3. Rotate credentials periodically
4. Use least-privilege access controls
5. Enable 2FA on all service accounts
