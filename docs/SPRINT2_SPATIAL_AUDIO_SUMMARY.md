  - `_position_character_voices()`: 3D positioning for story characters
  - `update_spatial_audio_preferences()`: User preference management

### 3. Mobile Spatial Audio Service
- ✅ Created `/mobile/src/services/spatialAudioService.ts`
- ✅ Client-side 3D audio processing with:
  - Web Audio API integration for browsers
  - Expo Audio fallback for mobile devices
  - Real-time source position updates
  - Soundscape management
  - Listener position tracking

### 4. Audio Playback Integration
- ✅ Enhanced `/mobile/src/services/audioPlaybackService.ts`
- ✅ Automatic spatial audio setup for stories and navigation
- ✅ Location context integration
- ✅ Story metadata support (characters, scenes)
- ✅ Listener position updates

### 5. API Endpoints
- ✅ Created `/backend/app/routes/spatial_audio.py`
- ✅ Created `/backend/app/schemas/spatial_audio.py`
- ✅ Endpoints:
  - `POST /orchestration/spatial-audio`: Main coordination
  - `POST /spatial-audio/environment`: Environment updates
  - `POST /spatial-audio/source/update`: Source position updates
  - `GET /spatial-audio/debug`: Debug information
  - `POST /spatial-audio/preferences`: User preferences

### 6. Testing
- ✅ Created `/backend/tests/test_spatial_audio.py`
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage:
  - Environment detection
  - Source management
  - Soundscape creation
  - 3D positioning calculations
  - HRTF processing
  - Doppler effect
  - Environmental reverb
  - Full integration flow

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Intelligent Environment Detection
The system automatically detects the audio environment based on:
- Terrain type (forest, mountain, desert, etc.)
- Road type (highway, tunnel, bridge)
- Population density
- Landmarks

### 2. Immersive Soundscapes
Each environment has unique acoustic properties:
- **Forest**: Birds, wind through trees, natural reverb
- **City**: Urban rumble, traffic, reflective surfaces
- **Highway**: Road noise, minimal reverb
- **Mountain**: Long echoes, distant sounds
- **Coastal**: Ocean waves, seagulls, open acoustics
- **Tunnel**: Heavy reverb, enclosed space

### 3. Advanced Audio Processing
- **HRTF**: Realistic 3D positioning using head-related transfer functions
- **ITD/ILD**: Interaural time and level differences for spatial perception
- **Doppler**: Frequency shifts for moving sounds
- **Distance Attenuation**: Sounds get quieter with distance
- **Environmental Reverb**: Realistic reflections based on surroundings

### 4. Dynamic Audio Positioning
- **Narrator**: Positioned slightly in front (0, 0, 0.3)
- **Navigation**: Front and elevated (0, 0.2, 0.5) for clarity
- **Characters**: Positioned around listener for dialogue
- **Ambient**: Distributed in 3D space based on source type

### 5. Smooth Transitions
- Environment changes generate smooth acoustic transitions
- 2-second crossfades between different acoustic spaces
- Prevents jarring audio changes

## Integration Points

### Story Playback
```typescript
// When playing a story
audioPlaybackService.setStoryMetadata(characters, scene);
await audioPlaybackService.play({
  id: 'story-123',
  uri: storyAudioUrl,
  type: 'story',
  volume: 1.0
});
// Spatial audio automatically configured
```

### Navigation Voice
```typescript
// Navigation instructions get spatial positioning
await audioPlaybackService.handleNavigationInstruction(
  audioUrl,
  orchestrationAction,
  duration
);
// Navigation voice positioned for optimal clarity
```

### Location Updates
```typescript
// Update listener position as vehicle moves
await audioPlaybackService.updateSpatialListenerPosition({
  heading: 45,
  speed: 65
});
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Sample Rate**: 48kHz for high-quality spatial audio
2. **Buffer Size**: 2048 samples for low latency
3. **Processing**: Optimized DSP algorithms
4. **Fallback**: Stereo panning when full 3D not available

## Mobile Platform Support

- **iOS**: Full Web Audio API support in WebView
- **Android**: Expo Audio with stereo panning fallback
- **Web**: Complete spatial audio with HRTF

## Next Steps (Sprint 3)

The spatial audio engine is now fully integrated and ready for use. Next sprint will focus on:
- Enhanced story generation with narrative arcs
- Quality scoring for generated content
- Integration with spatial audio for dynamic story scenes

## Usage Example

```python
# Backend coordinates spatial audio
result = await orchestrator.coordinate_spatial_audio(
    'story',
    {
        'terrain': 'forest',
        'road_type': 'rural',
        'weather': {'condition': 'rain'},
        'speed': 45
    },
    {
        'characters': [
            {'name': 'Old Ranger'},
            {'name': 'Young Explorer'}
        ],
        'scene': 'mystery_in_woods'
    }
)

# Returns soundscape configuration with:
# - Forest environment with rain
# - Narrator positioned front-center
# - Characters positioned left/right
# - Ambient forest sounds with rain
# - All sources properly spatialized
```

The spatial audio system is production-ready and will dramatically enhance the immersive experience of road trip stories!
