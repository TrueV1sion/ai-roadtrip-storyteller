# Directions Service API Documentation

## Overview

The Directions Service provides enhanced routing capabilities with real-time traffic data, place information, and route optimization. Built on top of the Google Maps Platform, it offers additional features like caching, rate limiting, and traffic predictions.

## Base URL

```
https://api.example.com/v1
```

## Authentication

All requests require a client ID to be passed in the header:

```
X-Client-ID: your_client_id
```

Rate limits are tracked per client ID:
- 50 requests per minute
- 2500 requests per day

## Endpoints

### Get Directions

```http
GET /directions
```

Fetches optimized directions between two points with optional waypoints and enhanced features.

#### Error Responses

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 400 | Invalid request parameters |
| 429 | Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | Internal server error |
| 503 | Service temporarily unavailable |

#### Example Requests

1. Basic route:
```http
GET /directions?origin=40.7128,-74.0060&destination=40.7614,-73.9776
```

2. Optimized route with waypoints:
```http
GET /directions?origin=40.7128,-74.0060&destination=40.7614,-73.9776&waypoints=40.7527,-73.9772|40.7589,-73.9851&optimize_route=true
```

3. Future departure with traffic:
```http
GET /directions?origin=40.7128,-74.0060&destination=40.7614,-73.9776&departure_time=2024-02-21T09:00:00Z&traffic_model=pessimistic
```

## Caching

- Responses with traffic data are cached for 2 minutes
- Responses without traffic data are cached for 5 minutes
- Offline cache is available as fallback during API outages

## Rate Limiting

The service implements a token bucket rate limiter:
- Rate: 50 requests per minute
- Burst: 10 requests
- Daily limit: 2500 requests per client

When rate limited, the service returns a 429 status code.

## Best Practices

1. **Cache Usage**:
   - Use cached responses when possible
   - Include traffic data only when needed

2. **Route Optimization**:
   - Use `optimize_route=true` for routes with multiple waypoints
   - Consider time windows for traffic predictions

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries
   - Handle offline mode gracefully

4. **Performance**:
   - Request only needed features
   - Use appropriate cache durations
