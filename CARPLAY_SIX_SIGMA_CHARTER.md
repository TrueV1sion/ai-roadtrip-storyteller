# Six Sigma DMAIC Charter: CarPlay Integration

## Project Charter

### Project Title
Apple CarPlay Integration for AI Road Trip Storyteller

### Business Case
With 79% of new vehicles supporting Apple CarPlay and 62% of drivers considering it a "must-have" feature, integrating CarPlay is critical for user adoption and safety. Voice-first interaction while driving reduces accidents by 23% compared to touch interfaces.

### Problem Statement
Currently, drivers must interact with their phone screen while driving, creating safety hazards and providing a suboptimal experience. The app lacks integration with vehicle infotainment systems, limiting its accessibility and usability during trips.

### Goal Statement
Implement a comprehensive CarPlay interface that provides 100% voice-controllable functionality, reduces driver distraction by 80%, and maintains feature parity with the mobile app while respecting Apple's CarPlay Human Interface Guidelines.

### Project Scope
- **In Scope**: Map display, navigation, voice control, story playback, games, settings
- **Out of Scope**: Video content, complex visual elements, payment processing

### Success Metrics
- Zero touch interactions required while driving
- <2 second response time for voice commands
- 100% feature accessibility via voice
- <3 taps to access any feature when parked
- 95% crash-free sessions
